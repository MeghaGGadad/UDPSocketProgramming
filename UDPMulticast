One of the features of CoAP protocal which supports both unicast and multicast.
CoAP supports making requests to an IP multicast group. This is defined by a series of deltas to unicast CoAP as defined 
in https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/rfc7252.pdf.
CoAP endpoints that offer services that they want other endpoints to be able to find using multicast service discovery join one or 
more of the appropriate all-CoAP-node multicast addresses (Section 12.8) and listen on the default CoAP port. 
#UDPMulticastServer

This server is a time server(displays the current time and port) that will helps to broadcast the current data and time every second. 
This is a good use for multicast messages as there may be multiple clients interested in the same information, 
and where reliability is not a major concern

#UDPMulticastClient
This application will join the multicast group as defined by the address 228.5.6.7.
It will block until a message is received, and then it will display the message.
